# GogoWatch

* GogoWatch scans the combat log and alerts players who mistakenly use low-rank abilities, like the legacy add-on RankWatch.
* Many Legitimate Low-rank Abilities have already been excluded, like All Heals, Rank 1 Frost Bolt, Rank 1 Earth Shock, Rank 1 Blizzard, etc.
* GogoWatch will only send one message per ability per time you are grouped up, spam should be minimal.
* There are likely bugs! Please report them on Discord! https://discord.gg/GegY9JMuKQ
* Coming soon: Alerts for when Players Die to Avoidable Game Mechanics, like the legacy add-on PhoenixStyle.
